# knitary
Displays knit patterns as binary.
#
This was an experiment to see what a knitting pattern might look like in binary output - to view the patterns, and mainly just out of curiosity. Would you believe it if I told you the output is a tea towel?

It currently only uses pre-written patterns with "k" "p" defining stitches, in the "patterns" folder. When I come back to this project, I hope to change it to accept different formatting that is less time consuming to write, and perhaps user input.
